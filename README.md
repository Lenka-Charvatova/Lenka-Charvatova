- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lenka-Charvatova and I am a Czech student of General Linguistics and Digital Humanities.
- 👀 I’m interested in NLP, mainly of my mothertongue, but also in combining classical and computational approach to literary studies. Basically any text analysis makes my day. :) I am also quite interested in data analysis - but in this field I still have a lot to learn.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming in Python, focused on NLP. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simply any linguistic research.
- 📫 How to reach me? Just send me a message here! :)
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I always say thank you to ChatGPT. Always.
